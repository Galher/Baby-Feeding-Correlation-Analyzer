# Baby Feeding Correlation Analyzer – Instructions

## Step 1: Generate Reports

Before running any graphs, you must first generate the necessary reports using the Excel data files.
You can run all reports with a single command:

    python run/run_all_reports.py

This will generate:
- Sleep report (`data/baby_daybook_log_sleep_report.csv`)
- Bottle report (`data/baby_daybook_log_bottle_report.csv`)
- Dirty diaper report (`data/baby_daybook_log_dirty_diaper_report.csv`)
- Weight report (`data/baby_weight_report.csv`) — includes **linearly interpolated daily weights**

> ⚠ Note: The weight report uses **linear interpolation** between weight points to estimate daily weights.
> In reality, baby weight growth is **not strictly linear**, so use this approximation cautiously.

## Step 2: Plot Graphs

After reports are generated, you can run all graphs at once:

    python run/run_all_graphs.py

This will display the following plots:
- Sleep hours vs. bottle volume (normalized)
- Bottle volume vs. dirty diapers (normalized)
- Bottle volume per kg (uses estimated daily weight)

---

## Normalization Details

Some graphs involve comparing different types of data (e.g., sleep hours vs. bottle volume).
To make the curves comparable, **min-max normalization** is applied to each variable:

    normalized_x = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))

This scales all values between 0 and 1 without altering their relative patterns.
